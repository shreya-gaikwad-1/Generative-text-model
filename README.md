A generative text model built using Hugging Face Transformers and implemented in Google Colab. It uses a pre-trained language model to generate text based on user input. Includes a Gradio interface for easy interaction and testing.

Features
- Text generation using Hugging Face pre-trained models
- Interactive Gradio UI for easy input and output
- Google Colab compatible – no local setup needed
- Supports transformer models like GPT-2.
  
Requirements
- Install required packages (if running locally): pip install transformers gradio torch

How to Use
- Run in Google Colab (replace link with your notebook): [Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Or run locally: python app.py
Then open the Gradio link in your browser to interact with the model.

Model Info
- Uses Hugging Face's pipeline("text-generation").
- Fully customizable: choose model, temperature, max length, etc.
